<section id="disclaimer" class="container my-5">
    <h2>Disclaimer: This Is All Make-Believe</h2>
    <p>PopSynth Studio is a completely fictional entity, existing solely in the digital void of imagination. This is not a real business, there are no actual services offered, and no AI-powered branding empire is secretly in development. Any resemblance to existing companies, creative agencies, or marketing geniuses is purely accidental and absolutely unintentional.</p>

    <p>If you were excited about launching your brand with PopSynth Studio, we regret to inform you that <strong>this site is just a playground for testing mobile-first web design.</strong> While the aesthetics may be striking and the structure well-crafted, none of it is functional beyond its experimental purpose. We promise not to judge if you mistook this for the next big thing in design—it just means the visuals are working.</p>

    <p>That being said, if anyone feels an overwhelming urge to bring PopSynth Studio into the real world, we won’t stand in your way. Until then, enjoy the neon brilliance, admire the digital craftsmanship, and remember—while this studio is fictional, <strong>the process of crafting engaging digital experiences is very real.</strong> Have fun exploring and testing!</p>
